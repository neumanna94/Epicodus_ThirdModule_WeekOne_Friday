# Super Galactic Age Calculator

## Description
Super Galatic Age Calculator is used to find your age on different planets in the Solar System.
Due to the distance different planets are away from the sun their years are either shorter or longer relative to Earth.
This project uses some simple conversion factors to find your rounded age on a few planets.

Furthermore, we store all user input in a results section of this single page web application as anonymous users.
